# agile-final-project
A fictitious project for a final assignment on Agile and Scrum course.
As a final project of the IBM Skills Networks Agile and Scrum course,
I need to Apply **Agile Best Practices** for some given Requirements for a cloud-deployed 
**backend product catalog** for an e-commerce website.

**FINAL PROJECT SCENARIO**

In this scenario, I will play the roles of a product owner, scrum master, and developer. 
As a product owner, I will create stories for my team and organize these stories into a product backlog. 
As a scrum master, I will create a sprint milestone and make sure that a subset of the stories is ready to be placed in a sprint plan. 
As a developer, I will create the sprint backlog and execute some of the stories by moving them across the kanban board in a simulated sprint.
